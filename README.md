# pokemon_battle_classification

The goal of this project is to create a classification model that will correctly predict the outcome of a Pokemon battle. The data for this project was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/terminus7/pokemon-challenge) and contains two different datasets: (1) Pokemon data for 800 unique Pokemon and (2) 50,000 battle outcomes for battles between two Pokemon. Along with creating an accurate classification model, I hope to give insight to Pokemon Trainers about which Pokemon characteristics are most likely to guarantee victory in battle. 

In this repository there are four notebooks:
 * **pokemon_data_cleaning**: Details the initial data cleaning process.
 * **pokemon_stats_eda**: Data exploration and hypothesis testing on Pokemon stats (HP, ATK, DEF, etc.). It also contains the feature engineering and the creation of the final dataset for the battle EDA and modelling. 
 * **pokemon_battle_eda**: Explores what characteristics are likely to contribute to a Pokemon's victory. It focuses on Pokemon types and status.
 * **pokemon_classification_model**: Walks through the modeling process and analysis of the results of the models.
